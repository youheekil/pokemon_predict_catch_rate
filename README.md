# pokemon_predict_catch_rate
Explore the pokemon data and try to predict pokemon's catch rate, how easy to catch the pokemon. 


Since, catch rate was continuous values, obviously multiple linear regression is more effective to predict the catch rate. 
At the same time, I treid decision tree to predict the catch rate.
